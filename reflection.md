# Reflection

This past 6 months of capstone has been a wild journey that I could not have imagined but I wouldn't want any other 
adventure. I thought I had a good idea of what the entire UCD process was like start to finish going through a few other
UCD classes (HCDE 308 and HCDE 418) but capstone exposed me an experience that I haven't had before.

One thing that I did not expect was to be a part of such a research heavy capstone project. When my team and I first
read the project proposal from Dropbox, we thought it would be a nice mix of research and design. However, research ended
up taking roughly 60% of the available time we had just because we were working in such a big problem space. Gen-Z and
files are enormous domains that can go in any number of directions and so when Dropbox asked about the intersection of
both we knew we had a lot of work to do. 

Research generally isn't my area of expertise so I ended up not taking much of a lead or doing a lot of the research
heavy tasks such as analyzing data or synthesizing insights. Though, I did my best to help out where I could in areas
that did fit me more such as organizing the logistics for all the interviews and proofreading all the copies we needed
for research.

As a result of research taking up a majority of the time, the time we spent in ideation and prototyping lasted much shorted 
than we anticipated. Ideation and prototyping both took approximately two weeks each which meant that we were going at a
rapid pace for each of the phases. I full participated in the ideation phase but prototyping was when it started to get
mixed for me. We started do prototyping in week 8 and 9 of Spring quarter and as a result, the video and poster
process was going on at the exact same time. 

Originally, two of us were supposed to be focused on the video and the other two on the poster. I was in the video
group since I had experience filming and editing videos in the past but I also ended up doing a lot of work on the poster
itself as well. Mostly this came up as I tend to stay up more at night (and function more during all nighters than the 
rest of my group) and so when we were in our last push to finish everything, I was just jumping back and forth between
video, poster, and prototypes as needed. The last week definitely did a number on me but we pulled through in the end 
and successfully completed our project.

Looking back at the last 6 months, I honestly am so proud of the work that I've done and the people I got to work with.
It was such an amazing time working on this project with friends because of all the little memories we made in between 
the late nights we had trying to get assignments in. I could not have asked for a better group or a better capstone
experience and this will be something I will remember forever.
