For our first research method, we conducted a survey to gain baseline insights about our target population of Gen-Z creative students.

## Goals

The main goal of the survey was to gain basic learnings of device and tool usage on creative projects. After preliminary secondary research and many brainstorming sessions, the research question we hope to answer specifically with the survey was: **What tools, storage systems, and devices do Gen-Z creatives use when working on projects?**

The survey will allow us to gather baseline, quantitative data about device, tool, and storage usage in personal and group creative projects. With the quantitative data, we will have more information during our interviews (our next research phase). Our survey was implemented and shared as a Google Form with different kinds of questions which allowed us to study and analyze the results for quantitative data. See the appendix for the full list of the questions in the survey.

## Participants

We sent our survey to 10 different channels which included Slack channels, Facebook groups and club group chats. Most members of those channels fell into our inclusion criteria, which is as follows:

- 18-25 years old (Gen-Z)
- College student 
- Worked on at least **one** creative project in college 
- Worked on at least **one** create project in the last six months 
- Worked with **digital devices** for creative projects

We received 83 responses to our survey, and only 67 of those were responses that met our inclusion criteria. 

## Insights

To find these insights, we imported the data from Google Forms into Google Sheets and cleaned the data. This involved separating lists of items into their own columns and standardizing spelling and capitalization. From there, we performed a basic statistical analysis with the quantitative data.

1. **When using multiple devices for a project, laptops are most commonly paired with a mobile phone.**
   
    Participants were able to choose multiple devices that they use for their projects, and the pairing of “Laptop/Desktop” and “Mobile Phone” was chosen by 32.8% of respondents. However, 31.3% of respondents chose only “Laptop/Desktop,” which is not far behind the pairing of Laptop/Desktop and Mobile phones. From our survey we can not be sure why there is this small of a difference, but we can tell that both of these options were fairly common.

2. **Overall, students are most commonly using a laptop/desktop device to work on their creative projects**

    Although most commonly the Laptop/Desktop is paired with a mobile phone, overall, most respondents use a Laptop/Desktop, regardless of what else they pair it with to complete a creative project. 97% of respondents reported working with a Laptop/Desktop to complete their creative projects, whereas only 55% of respondents reported using a Mobile Phone to complete a creative project.

    Not only is the laptop the most commonly used device, it is also the most preferred digital device. 67.2% of respondents ranked a Laptop/Desktop as their highest preference for devices, whereas only 6% of respondents ranked a mobile phone as their highest preference.

3. **Most commonly, students combine cloud storage, email, and instant messaging (IM) to share files in group projects**

    When given many options on how to share files in group projects, 20.9% of respondents reported using cloud storage, email, and instant messaging to share files between group messaging. There were many other combinations, such as 12% using only cloud storage or 10.4% using cloud storage and instant messaging, but combining all three modes seemed to be the most popular.

4. **Overall, students use cloud storage systems to share files when working on group projects**

    Similarly to the findings on device usage, although the combinations of file sharing were more popular, overall most students reported using cloud storage the most frequently. Out of every survey response, 65.7% of respondents reported using cloud storage to share files between group members regardless of whether it was combined with another service or not. Other notable methods of file sharing included email (50.7% of respondents) and instant messaging (44.6% of respondents).

    Out of those who reported using cloud services to share files, 63% stated that Google Drive was their primary cloud service. Other services mentioned were Figma, OneDrive, Dropbox, and Google Photos, but there was only one respondent for each of those services. 

5. **For personal use, students typically combine local and cloud storage to store their files for creative projects**

    When able to choose multiple options for how respondents store their personal files, 31.3% reported using a combination of local and cloud storage services. However, not far behind was 29% of respondents using only local storage to store their personal files.

6. **Overall, students are most commonly using local storage to store their files.**

   Regardless of what local storage was combined with for personal file storage, 88% of respondents reported using local storage to save their personal work, whereas cloud storage was reported 53.7% of the time. While students are still using cloud storage and actually frequently couple it with local storage, it seems that overall local storage is more favorable to Gen-Z creatives.
