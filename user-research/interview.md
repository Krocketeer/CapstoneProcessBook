## Goals

The survey study did well in generalizing a number of high level insights into how Gen-Z students interact with and organize files for creative projects. However, our findings were limited in the fact that it did not give us an understanding as to why each of these trends occurred. Due to the nuanced nature of workflows, it was difficult to find out much about them with quantitative metrics from a survey. In addition, we were not sure if what we found could be generalized for a larger audience than one that we were able to survey. In order to meet both of these limitations, we conducted an interview study to learn more about how Gen-Z students work on their creative projects, with a focus on their workflows and how it relates to technology and their files.

## Participants

The interview study consisted of twelve, 30 to 45 minute interviews conducted over Zoom, spaced over the course of a week and a half. A semi-structured approach was used to allow a consistent structure between all interviews while having the ability to go in-depth into the participants’ responses as well. In order to align the interview study with the results from the survey, we conducted interviews on participants under the same inclusion criteria:

- 18-25 years old (Gen-Z)
- College student
- Worked on at least **one** creative project in college
- Worked on at least **one** create project in the last six months
- Worked with **digital devices** for creative projects

## Insights

Our interviews primarily centered around how participants collected, organized, retrieved, and used files throughout their workflows for creative projects. In particular, we asked participants to focus on how they managed their files and interacted with different devices on one specific project. This allowed us to get a concrete understanding of why users had their preferences and made certain decisions when it came to their workflows.

We transcribed all interview recordings and coded the interviews for insights relevant to our research question. From there, we affinity diagrammed our insights into general topics and used inductive reasoning to pull out higher level insights. Further synthesis of our interview insights is still in progress and will be accompanied by more data following our diary study. For our direct insights, we were able to categorize these insights into four general topic spaces: Devices, Tools, Local vs. Cloud, and File Usage (CORU)[^1].

[^1]: CORU: Collect, Organize, Retrieve, Use

### Devices

- **A common multi-device workflow identified among students is sharing files from their phone to their laptop.** 

    Students whose devices are within the Apple ecosystem use Airdrop to share files among their devices. Otherwise, students reported using third party messaging services where they could message themselves, such as email or Discord. This workflow was most frequently brought up during students’ processes for gaining inspiration on their projects. Students would sketch something on paper, capture the sketch on their phone, share the image to their laptop, then upload the image to a document.

### Tools

- **Commons motivations for tool selection include**:
  - **Familiarity and Industry Standards**

    Particularly when asked to justify their choice for creative tools, many students reported not wanting to tackle another learning curve or using a tool because it was industry standard.
    
  - **Affordability**

    The vast majority of students favor tools that don’t have a subscription cost. For example, the vast majority of students use Google Drive as their primary cloud storage service due to the free storage they receive through their universities.

  - **Community**

    For collaborative work, students opt for the tools that accommodate the most people on their teams, for example, Google Drive over Notion, or Slack over Discord. However, this is unique to each team. 

  - **No Agency**

    For students working on creative projects in school or other professional settings, many of them reported not having agency over their tools or cloud storage service as it was set in place by their instructors.

### Local vs. Cloud

- **Common motivations for using the cloud include**:
  - **Collaborative work**

    The cloud enables an ease of synchronous work and sharing content among students and their teams.
  
  - **Immediate access across all personal devices**

    Many users reported interacting with the Cloud for immediate content retrieval from all their devices. Examples of this include accessing their photos through Google Photos from their phone and laptop, uploading links to the Notes app to access from another device, or using Notion to access content from both their iPad and laptop.

- **While both sides were expressed, many students reported that their local storage is more organized than the Cloud.**

  The minority of students reported continuously synchronizing their local and cloud storages and having identical organization between the two. Consequently, several students reported that they struggled more with file organization on the Cloud than their local storage. 

    - *“But obviously when I look at my own personal Google drive I have files from when I was an adolescent, you know, from middle school and elementary school. … it is definitely a mess." (P2)*
    - *“Sometimes I think I'm just not consistent in my own file organization, especially on Google Drive because I tend to just make a new doc and it just all shows up on my drive instead of [being] organized in their files. So, a lot of times I'm more organized on my local hierarchy and my local files…” (P4)*
    - *“No, my cloud is pretty dirty, I will admit that. I think because I use it sometimes I cross over like school and personal on the same drive instead of moving it over to my personal one, things kind of get messy and so that's overwhelming to me, … I think it's because it has so much more things, I wouldn't even know how to categorize it at that point like it’s just very dirty and I will leave it at that.” (P4)*

- **Local storage is favored for when quick or frequent file access is needed.**

  During a work session, students reported downloading frequently accessed files that exist in the cloud to their local storage for ease of access. Similarly, many students reported using their desktop as a permanent “priority” space for their local storage. We are investigating this insight further through our diary study.

### File Usage (CORU)[^1]

- **For more immediate needs, students typically use instant messaging (IM) to share content with others.**

    While students are using a cloud storage service for collaborative projects, many students reported using a IM platform to share files when a more immediate response is needed.

    - *"Then take a copy of that to send to everyone, usually using Facebook messenger… it's really quick because that's the messaging app I use, so I just send a video to them and then we have that conversation back and forth… but if we need to present it to an actual class or something, usually we put it in the Google drive so that everyone has access to it.” (P7)*
    - *"If it's something that is downloadable we will throw it on cloud or our Google drive, but if it's something that's this kind of needed for immediate attention, we will drop it into Google Drive but also drop it in Slack. And then any links that we just need to look for that one instance in that one work session, we’ll just drop it in Discord because we’re all already there and we can all see it right away." (P9)*

- **Similarly, some students opted for sharing screenshots over larger files when a more immediate response was needed.**

    - *“Or if we just wanted opinions on something, then we'd screenshot a Figma file on there, but we wouldn't actually send the Figma file that’s stored in our Figma team thing." (P12)*
    - *"No, I'd say the only thing we did was maybe send a screenshot of like ‘I'm confused about this, could anyone help me?’ Then they would hop on, we used Discord for a little bit at the end, because of the time crunch." (P4)*

- **Some users reported using direct messages (DMs) as a personalized “history” to aid file retrieval.**

  Instead of going through their cloud storage service, users reported benefits of sharing and retrieving content through their DMs. We are investigating this insight further through our diary study.

    - *“On DMs it's just like so much easier to track. I reserved those DMs just for files… I don't want to have images and stuff I have to find on a shared channel… Basically what would happen would be I get the assets and I get them from those private DMS and then I just save them locally on my computer.” (P6)*

- **While both methods were expressed, many users favor manually locating files in storage when good organization is in place.**

  Despite having access to search features on both their local devices and cloud storage, many students reported manually locating a file via its file path instead of using the search feature. Several students found this quicker than locating the correct file in the results of a search feature.

- **Students typically organize and clean their file systems when they determine their systems are “too messy,” but the level of messiness is subjective.**

  Another workflow identified among many students was periodic cleaning and organizing of their file systems. However, the timeline for this is often miscellaneous and subjective to each user.

  - *"Yeah, it’s temporary storage and I do it until it gets to the point where I can't do it anymore, and then I have to sit down and clean up, put everything in a folder, free up the desktop space and then I can do it again." (P9)*
  - *"I do that sometimes like maybe once.. I would once every six to eight month when it gets really out of hand, where I'm like ‘wow this is terrible’, I would organize it." (P10)*
  - *"Yeah I guess when my computer gets really lagging then I'm like, ‘oh shoot’, and then I just mass delete a bunch of things." (P12)*
  - *“Yeah I think..If it's not overwhelming, but I don't know how I would quantify what the threshold is." (P2)*

## Next Steps

As we begin solidifying our interview data, we hope to further our findings through a diary study, focusing on students’ workflows, multi-device usage, and file storage, specifically sharing and retrieving. We are currently drawing out and synthesizing our interview findings. Many of them have focused on files within local and cloud platforms, specifically within the scope of laptops and computers. We have learned that most students tend to associate work strictly with computers, and especially when they prefer to keep their personal and work separate; phones are often tied strictly to recreation. Aside from the brief mentions of communication through mobile devices, participants rarely spoke to their phones being a part of their workflows. We also discovered tablets similarly are not often used for much execution of work, aside from sketching or other pencil required functions. Even for sketching, once completed, they are often transferred over to a computer to further the work. With our diary study we are hoping to uncover ways other devices may subconsciously play a role in students’ workflows, and the relationship between multiple devices. We have chosen a diary study method to observe all the nuanced actions students make — that they may not even recall when asked about.

The study is planned to run about one week. Following the same inclusion criteria as our surveys and interviews, we have recruited six college students ages 18-25 years old, to document their file management habits across different devices as they work on a creative project. We are asking them to take note of various occurrences of device use and file management over the course of three one-hour work sessions. Proceeding each session, they are also asked to reflect on their observations through answering a set of questions we have provided. See the appendix for the full list of the reflection questions and diary entry prompts. We are hoping to learn more about their subconscious habits and preferences for devices and the way they connect with one another. As well as any unrecalled biases towards methods of file storing and sharing. All to better inform our next stage of ideation, where we hope to create new concepts for seamless interconnectivity across devices as well as platforms for content creation, organization, retrieval, and use (CORU).
