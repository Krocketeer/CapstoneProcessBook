## Goals
The main goal of this presentation was to use the evidence from our surveys and interviews to create a well informed direction for our next phase: ideation. To narrow our research question, *“How do Gen-Z creatives Collect, Organize, Retrieve, and Use content across different devices and surfaces when working on projects?”*, down to a more focused point, we synthesized our findings to hone in on technological habits that Gen-Z students have built to complete their work. Although it is still uncertain that these tendencies are entirely unique to Gen-Z, given our limited knowledge on other generations, it did give interesting insight to general motivations and how we may be able to build functionalities to support these aspects of their workflows.

We chose the format of a slide deck to present our research for ease of use for our sponsor, as they have expressed that reading an extensive paper is often undesired due to their limited-bandwidth and likewise for any higher-ups they would hope to share this with. The slide deck format allows them to learn about our results in a short amount of time in a visual and engaging manner.

## Process
Once we had finished all of our interviews, we proceeded to transcribe and then code them by identifying interesting points or common themes. Once we had a collection of codes among the transcripts, we started to affinity diagram them under categories such as devices, tools, local vs cloud, file usage, and workflows. As we grouped the codes together, we pulled quotes and other insights from the interview transcripts to add more context to each of the categories. The added context allowed us to analyze any common trends from our research and eventually lead to our main insight of immediate file retrieval. We noticed among many interviews as well as survey responses that Gen-Z students tend to use ad-hoc methods in order to quickly send and receive files to support their workflows. It was interesting to note that no two students from our interviews shared the same ad-hoc method for immediate retrieval but they all achieved the same effect in the end. From there, we progressed to outline how we would present our research.

## Insights Narrative
From our survey and interview research methods, we learned a lot of interesting findings, but we have chosen to focus mostly on the multi-device usage of Gen-Z creative students.

Not surprisingly, Gen-Z students need the cloud to complete collaborative work. From our survey, we found that 59.7% of users use Google Drive as their main storage device (Figure 1). Although collaborative work is the main motivator for cloud usage, many students claim that using the cloud, specifically Google Drive, is more affordable. 7/12 of our interviewees stated that they used cloud storage services that were free to use, which was an added convenience to them as students. As all of our interviewees were students from the University of Washington, 5/12 of them also claimed that they used Google Drive since it had free unlimited storage for them, a benefit provided by the university. Being students, they also have less agency over the cloud storage that they use because of cost or due to their professors/industry professionals that telling students to do so.

***Figure 1**: 59.7% of students (40/67) from our survey reported using Google Drive as their primary form of cloud storage, clearly beating out other cloud storage systems.*

Even though students need to use the cloud, their cloud organization is usually messy. The minority of students (2/12 interviewees) regularly sync up their cloud storage and local storage; many students just let their files pile up in the cloud while they have a different organizational strategy for their local storage. There were a few reasons we saw this in our interviews. Some students have been using the cloud since they were young and their files have just continued to live in their Google Drive. For instance, P2 states, “But obviously when I look at my own personal Google Drive, I have files from when I was an adolescent, you know, from middle school and elementary school… It is definitely a mess." Other users stated that the workflow of saving a file on the cloud is not as organized as saving on local storage. Google Drive does not have a “Save As” feature that programs like Microsoft Word or Adobe Illustrator might have. When you create a Google Doc, it is created in your main drive and must be moved (Figure 2).

***Figure 2**: When users create a Google Doc, if the user is not specific about its location when it’s first created, the document just lives in the main drive. This results in a pile up of documents and worse organization*

Because of this lack of organization, students are less likely to organize their cloud storage since it just becomes overwhelming. P4 states, “I think it's because it has so much more things, I wouldn't even know how to categorize it at that point like it’s just very dirty and I will leave it at that.”

Another very interesting insight we found lies in Gen-Z’s need for immediate content sharing. This can be broken down into immediate sharing between group members and with their own devices.

Gen-Z students are using instant messaging services to immediately share content with one another. This content includes links, files, and even screenshots of large files that cannot be shared directly due to their size. P6 states, “We [were] just moving really fast…We just wanted to make stuff and then send it over you know? You're prioritizing speed and what worked fastest was just sending me PNGs on Slack DMs.” Students wanted to be able to share their work faster than uploading directly to the Cloud.

Another workflow we saw from immediate content sharing was between personal devices. If students had content on their phones that they wanted to access on their computer, they found many ways to do so. Students that had Apple devices relied heavily on the Apple Ecosystem (Airdrop, cross device app sync, etc.), and students that did not have Apple devices relied on cloud services like instant messaging services and Google Drive. However, what we found was that most students cared about getting things to themselves quickly. 33% of our survey respondents paired their mobile phone and laptop/desktop to complete creative projects. Even though laptops are doing most of the heavy lifting on creative projects, clearly students value pairing their mobile phones with their laptops to do their work (Figure 3). However, with the multitude of ways that students are pairing them, it is important to focus on this workflow and see if there are ways to improve this experience for students.

## Next Steps

Our team presented the first draft of our Insights Report to the Design Strategy Team at Dropbox this past week. We are in the process of incorporating their feedback. Most revisions being made are in regards to visual design and presentation delivery. We will send over one final draft of the deck at the beginning of Week 6, May 2nd. In regards to our general narrative and proposed design question, we received positive feedback and got the green light to move forward with the next phase of our capstone: ideation. We have concluded our research with a preliminary design question to launch of ideation:

**How might we support Gen-Z creatives in immediate content sharing across multiple devices?**

We have scheduled weekly meetings with the Dropbox Team for the remainder of our capstone. The Dropbox team will lead us through our first Ideation Jam Session this coming Thursday, May 5th. The Dropbox team will be an important resource for this part of our design process due to their domain and product knowledge. While we are not limited to an existing Dropbox feature or product, we will begin our ideation by identifying how Dropbox currently supports “immediate content sharing”, if at all. Ideation will span weeks 6 and 7 of the quarter (May 5th - May 3th) and the structure of our timeline will be further defined through the kickoff ideation jam session happening this week.
