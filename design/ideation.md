## Ideation Survey

### Ideation Survey Goals

With this survey, we aimed to gain a basic understanding of the following: 

- Clipboard usage across devices
- Screenshot (ephemeral content) usage across devices
- How Gen-Z students share/access content with themselves across devices
- Cross-referencing this with the types of devices they use (Apple Ecosystem users vs. Non Apple Ecosystem)

### Participants

Our group members sent out this survey to various channels, including our Instagram stories, Slack channels, and club group chats. Our inclusion criteria is as follows:

| Criteria | Reasoning |
| -------- | --------- |
| 18 - 25  | This is the age range for Gen-Z that we are interested in for the scope of this project |
| College Students | We want to hear about student experiences, not necessarily professional experiences |
| Used a digital device in the past 6 months to work on a creative project | As we are creating a digital product, we need to hear from those that use digital devices. We chose 6 months as our time span so respondents could remember how they used the device. |

### Insights

Our insights can be broken down into the following categories: content transfer, screenshot usage, and clipboard usage. We asked survey respondents the type of phone, computer, and, if applicable, tablet that they own. By doing so, we were able to break down our data even further to learn how certain user types behave, especially when considering how the Apple Ecosystem is utilized. We wanted to make this distinction because in our user interviews, we found that many users without the full Apple Ecosystem struggled with transferring content across their devices quickly. With this survey, we can confirm or adjust these findings. These types of users are Full Apple Users, Partial Apple Users, and Non-Apple Users. These are defined as follows:

| User Type | Definition | 
| --------- | ---------- |
| Full Apple User | All devices are Apple products, therefore connected via the Apple ecosystem |
| Partial Apple User | At least one device is Apple, but other devices may be non-Apple. |
| Non-Apple User | No devices are Apple products |

#### Content Transfer

When asked, “How do you usually transfer content between your devices?,” most students responded with Cloud storage, email, and Airdrop (Figure 1). When broken down by device, Full Apple Users were more likely to use Airdrop, and Non-Apple Users use either cloud storage or Email. When asked why they transfer content that way, it really came down to these three key  concepts: fast, easy, and convenient. This finding is a confirmation from our interviews.

***Figure 1**: Broken down by Full Apple User, Partial Apple User, and Non-Apple User, we’re able to see the most common ways that users transfer content between their own devices.*

#### Screenshot Usage

There were many different responses when asked about the common reasons that people take screenshots, but these are just a few:

- To remember information for later
- Generally saving and sharing information
- For class assignments/projects
- Sendings memes/things to their friends
- Transferring content between devices
- Easier to screenshot than to save something 

#### Clipboard Usage

We were especially interested in how people use their clipboard currently as we think it could be a potential solution for our ideation question (Figure 2). When broken down by devices, users were fairly familiar with the clipboard capabilities on computers – 20 respondents were extremely familiar with their computers’ clipboard capabilities and 15 respondents were moderately familiar. For phones, 14 respondents were extremely familiar with the clipboard capabilities and 15 respondents were moderately familiar.

***Figure 2**: When broken down between Phone, Computer, and Tablet, we’re able to see how users understand the capabilities of the clipboard on their different devices.*

Similar to the insights about why people share content the way they do, we learned that people use the clipboard because it’s fast and easy to use. Those that aren’t using the clipboard reported it’s because they don’t understand how to use it effectively and/or they don’t trust that the clipboard will complete the actions they need (e.g., uncertain what file types can be copied, pasting with correct formatting).

Common ways that people use the clipboard are for cross-device transfers, reformatting content, and general copying and pasting text.

## Ideation

After completing research, we moved onto the next phase of our project: ideation. This was a fast-paced week full of brainstorming and sketching, resulting in the final concept to answer our ideation question: **“How might we support immediate content sharing across multiple devices?”**

### Goals

Our main goal from the ideation phase of research was to formulate a design question. This differs from our research and ideation question in a few ways. Our research question focused on what we wanted to learn about our user group – how they work and what tools they use to work. Our ideation question scoped down our research question, allowing room for brainstorming, but still being supported by our research. Our design question, however, focused more on the final deliverable and the product we will pitch to Dropbox.

Along with our design question, we also planned to have a set of design goals based on our research insights. These design goals prompted the features to be included in our final design. Finally, our main goal was to have a concrete concept and plan for our prototyping phase and final deliverable.

### Process

#### Divergent Sketching

From scoping our research insights, we learned that Gen-Z creative students want to transfer content between their devices (no matter the operating system), quickly and easily. With these values in mind, we individually sketched possible design solutions to this problem. We chose to conduct divergent sketching to generate as many ideas as possible, without being influenced by one another (Figure 3). That way, when we presented our ideas to one another, we were able to gain a wider scope for a possible solution. Comparing the similarities and differences in our solutions, highlighting the strongest assets of each to bring into our final concept. We focused our sketches on the following prompt: *“How can we create a Clipboard that is less abstract for users, but is at the same time more robust?”*

***Figure 3**: (above) A mid-fi sketch depicting what it would look like if the clipboard lived in the toolbar menu on desktop. (top right) A sketch depicting a mobile shortcut to your clipboard. (bottom right) A sketch depicting accessing a clipboard from the context menu on desktop.*

From these sketches, we came to a few questions that we wanted to further explore in building the functionality of our new “clipboard”:

- What content is copied into the clipboard? 
- How do users check what’s in their clipboard? 
- How do people paste from their clipboard? 
- What would the clipboard look like across various devices/OS? 
- What if people want a piece of content forever (not just immediately)?

### Outcome

The concepts that came from our divergent sketching led us to Dropbox Clip. But before prototyping the actual design, we created design goals to focalize our scope:

#### Design Goals

- Support upload and retrieval from multiple devices 
- Make the clipboard less abstract
  - Help the user know that the clipboard exists. 
  - Help the user remember what is in their clipboard. 
  - Help the user know what the clipboard does.
- Support users’ actions during their work sessions
  - Frequent retrieval of the same file in a time span 
  - Recommendations based on trends in user actions
- Allow for user customization on how ephemeral a piece of content is
  - Understand that different pieces of content exist within different contexts/goals 
  - Capability to save content in the clipboard (local or cloud)
  - Help maintain long term cloud organization
- Make it familiar
  - Intuitive shortcuts
  - Accessible shortcuts 
  - Consistent shortcuts
  - Relating to current processes of sharing
- Make the clipboard do what the user expects it to do
  - Minimize uncertainty of functionality 
  - Customizable 
  - Consistent across devices/OS
