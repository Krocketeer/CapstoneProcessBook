First coming into college I was pretty unsure of what I wanted to pursue. I've always had an interest in visual arts but for practicality ventured towards working in STEM, which is how I ended up in HCDE! These last six months I’ve been a consulting intern on an application development team at RSM US LLP, mainly redesigning client websites and doing some front-end development. It was an interesting experience getting to work with a large variety of clients, each project being pretty different from the others. I got to spend a lot of time meeting people, assessing their needs, and hopefully finding solutions for their issues. Growing up I was given a lot of opportunities to work with many underprivileged groups, whether it was church mission trips or volunteering at the local food banks, I got to meet all kinds of people from very different walks of life. All of these experiences and relationships showed me the large disparity gap that is so prevalent in even everyday life; they’ve taught me the importance of understanding which is something that largely drives my work as a UX designer. Specifically, with this project I hope as a Gen-Z creative I can really empathize with our user group and exercise the value of taking the time to understand who we are creating for and create something meaningful.
