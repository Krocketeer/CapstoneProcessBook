My journey in design first started when I took an introductory course about inclusive design. It wasnâ€™t until then that I started to think about how important it is to design for all users. As a result, I strive to create equitable and inclusive experiences for all. During my time in HCDE, I conducted an exploratory study to understand the impact the HCDE K-12 Outreach program has had on their facilitators, spent four months as a UI/UX intern working on interface design for OpenPath, and created websites as a design intern for Anthem, Inc. I hope to apply my breadth of knowledge within the user-centered design process to work with Dropbox and help improve how Gen-Z students work on creative projects.
