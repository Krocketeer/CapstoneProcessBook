I entered the HCDE major being very excited about design and how it can impact the life of the everyday user. However, as I went through my courses, research groups, and internship, I gained a love for the research side of UX. This past summer I was an E-Commerce UX Researcher for Title Nine. I spent 10 weeks interviewing customers, analyzing trends, and presenting key insights to the CEO, President, and other other key stakeholders at the company. I enjoy connecting with users directly and learning from them to improve their experience. Iâ€™m excited to work with Dropbox and connect with Gen-Z students and learn first hand from them the ways that they work on creative projects.
