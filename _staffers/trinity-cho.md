What drew me to tech was the idea of inequitable user experiences and how both designers/developers have the power to shape those experiences. The majority of my industry experience has been in UX Design and I have some experience in software development as well. My background in UX Design is fairly well rounded, but I often gravitate towards the earlier stages of the design process: user research, analysis of user and business needs, solution ideating, and wireframing. While I donâ€™t think it will be my focus, I look forward to helping with higher fidelity and visual branding decisions as well. Outside of design, I have a significant amount of experience in team/project management. I am also passionate about storytelling through videography, so I look forward to working on video with my team for our final capstone deliverable.
