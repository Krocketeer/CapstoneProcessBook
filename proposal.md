## Introduction
After its founding in 2007, Dropbox became a pioneer of the file management and cloud storage industry. While there existed methods to store files, file management was limited to a single access point — local storage. As one of the first file hosting services, Dropbox allowed users to keep their files in sync and manage them from any device.
However, Dropbox’s popularity has declined as larger companies have created their own file hosting services: Google Drive and OneDrive are currently serving billions of users around the world. Furthermore, other companies have adopted the file, store, and share (FSS) model, eliminating the need for users to store their files in a separate service (e.g. Figma stores your files for you on their platform). Amidst this rise of the web era, the idea of “files” and how we share them are being abstracted away. Now, users are looking for ways to store and manage their content that exist both locally and on the web.

To address this, Dropbox is hoping to explore how they can serve a more specific user group, one that can not be served as well by their larger competitors: creative professionals. From speaking to users and working with their own designers, Dropbox noticed that creatives were working with a large amount of content across a wide variety of platforms, whether it was for personal or client use. As a result, creatives are forced to juggle many different platforms as they try to keep track of all of their content.

At the same time, the Design Strategy Team at Dropbox is especially curious about Gen-Z and how they interact with technology. Gen-Z will soon be a significant part of the workforce, and institutions are acknowledging that they lack a strong and accurate understanding of Gen-Z and their behaviors [^1]. It is not surprising but important to highlight that Gen-Z is considered the first “digital native” generation — technology has always played a central role in their lives and how they go about their work [^2]. Research already exists highlighting unique behaviors and attitudes of Gen-Z. For example, a majority of Gen-Z use their smartphone as the main device to access the internet compared to other generations who will traditionally use a computer [^3]. As a result, there is a rich opportunity to learn more about the characteristics and habits of Gen-Z and the implications it may have for the future of Dropbox’s technology. 

Our research question:

**How do Gen-Z creatives collect, organize, retrieve, and use (CORU) content across different devices and surfaces\* when working on projects?**

Our target user group is Gen-Z creatives living in North America who are attending college and are 18-25. We are defining a “creative” as someone who practices creativity in professional and/or formal contexts. “Projects” will be limited to educational or professional contexts. We will conclude our research with a key insight report and use our findings to form a more specific design question exploring ways that Dropbox can support Gen-Z creatives and their workflows.

More than half of Gen-Z believe that they are more creative than older generations. With an abundance of creative tools at their fingertips, they are leading a booming creator economy era where engaging in creative work has never been so accessible [^4]. While Dropbox is curious in learning about a more narrow user group and the nuances in how they work, it is very possible that valuing how to serve creative professionals now will lead Dropbox to serving everybody in the next 10 years.

## Design Challenges

In beginning our research, a challenge we anticipate encountering is that our question may be too broad. Since we are attempting to gather as much information about Gen-Z’s habits and relations with digital data, the downside in trying to understand such a wide scope is that we may have an overload of information as well as varying responses that are harder to organize and draw sound conclusions from. Our focus on workflows alone is very broad, as each individual is likely to have a unique way of defining their work and process in execution. We hope to alleviate some of this by narrowing down our questions to better focus our participants on specific works but do still expect a wide variety which may bring some difficulty in defining requirements for our design.

Another obstacle we foresee in our research is establishing our user group. We have scoped our question down to Gen-Z students/creatives, which will generally be college undergraduates, however, Gen-Z is more than just 18-25 year olds. There is a very wide range of ways to define Gen-Z and understand who they are, as each end of the spectrum already has many differing aspects to one another, representing them as one whole will be a great challenge. And as Gen-Z’s culture and generational values are driven by the world and its events, it is constantly and continuously evolving with the world, so defining what they are and recommending solutions to this ever-changing group will be a large obstacle.

## Timeline

### Research

In our research phase (Table 1), we will be talking directly to users about their behaviors, feelings, and understandings about how they use digital technologies to complete creative projects. This will consist of surveys, user interviews, and a diary study later in the phase. We’re starting with surveys and user research to gain basic understandings of workflows, and finishing off with a diary study to get real time data on how people work on their projects. The diary study is also last because we will be asking users to document how they work on creative projects, and we anticipate Week 4 and 5 of the quarter to be the most project-heavy weeks. From this user research, we hope to gain insights on not only the different types of workflows that users have, but the pain points and workarounds in these workflows. We will conduct quantitative and qualitative analysis to synthesize the findings from the research.

#### Table 1: Timeline of Research Phase

| Activity | Start Date | End Date |
| -------- | ---------- | -------- |
| Finalize Research Question | 2/28 | 3/4 |
| Secondary Research | 3/5 | 3/11 |
| Participant Recruitment | 3/16 | 3/23 |
| Survey | 3/16 | 3/23 |
| User Interviews | 3/24 | 4/16 |
| Diary Study | 4/17 | 4/23 | 
| Analyze Research | 4/10 | 4/27 |

### Ideation

During the ideation phase (Table 2) we will take information and data gained from the research phase and narrow our research question into a succinct design question. In order to do this, we will have jam sessions within our own team and with the Dropbox team. With a scoped design question, we will brainstorm design solutions and potential features for Dropbox to implement to support our user group. We will also produce an insights report from the research and ideation phases. This document will include key facts learned from research.

#### Table 2: Timeline of the Ideation Phase

| Activity | Start Date | End Date |
| -------- | ---------- | -------- |
| Design Requirements/Opportunities | 4/24 | 4/30 |
| Insights Report | 4/24 | 5/7 |

### Prototyping

Drawing from the ideation phase, we will produce Lo-Fi and Hi-Fi prototypes made on Figma (Table 3). We’ll start out with divergent prototyping, each taking our work from the ideation phase and producing sketches for implementation. It’s not possible to say what these prototypes might consist of, but we hope to have some sort of visual display of our design solutions for our key stakeholders.

#### Table 3: Timeline of the Prototyping Phase

| Activity | Start Date | End Date |
| -------- | ---------- | -------- |
| Divergent Prototyping | 5/1 | 5/6 |
| Lo-Fi Prototyping | 5/6 | 5/9 |
| Hi-Fi Prototyping | 5/10 | 5/14 |

### Presentation

Our three final deliverables for this project are a slide deck presentation as requested by our sponsor, a poster for Capstone showcase, and a video for capstone showcase (Table 4). Given that our project deliverables may be more research based, we will have to be creative with the format and style of our video.

#### Table 4: Timeline of the Presentation Phase

| Activity | Start Date | End Date |
| -------- | ---------- | -------- |
| Final Slide Deck (for Dropbox) | 5/15 | 6/4 |
| Poster | 5/15 | 6/1 |
| Video | 5/15 | 6/1 |

## Ethical Considerations

As we begin interacting with our research participants, one thing we will keep in mind is that as we are asking participants to talk about projects they have or are currently working on, it is important to consider this as confidential unless otherwise noted. Since many projects, especially those in progress, may contain private information to the participant or the larger group/company they are a part of, it is crucial to the participant’s privacy that we incorporate forms of verifying what information we may disclose in our findings and to whom. Another ethical aspect we must consider in asking about participants’ creative work is that since there is a subjective nature to creativity, it is likely that their works may be affected by their own personal values and beliefs. As we are attempting to create a holistic and objective representation of Gen-Z’s technological culture and its effects on creative workflows, we must be wary of participants’ personal biases that may alter or skew how we define the culture.

In focusing our research on Gen-Z college students, who are most likely going to be from the University of Washington or the greater Seattle area due to accessibility, there are some biases to consider about this specific user group. Scoping down to solely college students, generally speaking, many students often come from mid to upper class families that are of higher financial status as higher level education/tuition is quite expensive, so it is not accessible to all people. This already narrows the pool of who we are considering for our definition of Gen-Z. It is important to remember this exclusion as we share our findings, that this is only a small scope of a much larger picture. Another bias we anticipate is since the Seattle area is such a tech hub, many of our participants may have a more experienced technical background due to their circumstances and surroundings. We must be careful in how we define the technological culture of Gen-Z since we are focusing on a particularly saturated area for technology.
